# Example JWKS Fixture Configuration
# 
# This is a conceptual example of what JWKS fixture configuration might look like
# if we add config-based fixture support in the future.
#
# Currently, JWKS fixtures must be created programmatically in Go tests using:
#   httpfixture.NewJWKSFixture(httpfixture.JWKSFixtureConfig{...})
#
# See internal/httpfixture/README.md for usage examples.

# Conceptual syntax for future config-based fixtures:
fixtures:
  - type: jwks
    name: prod-jwt-issuer
    issuer: https://auth.prod.example.com
    jwks_url: https://auth.prod.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json
    key_id: prod-key-1
    algorithm: RS256
    # In config mode, the fixture would:
    # 1. Generate RSA key pair on startup
    # 2. Serve JWKS at the configured URL
    # 3. Expose signing API for test token creation

  - type: jwks
    name: test-jwt-issuer
    issuer: https://auth.test.example.com
    jwks_url: https://auth.test.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json
    key_id: test-key-1
    algorithm: RS256

  # Generic HTTP fixtures can be mixed with specialized fixtures
  - type: http_rule
    request:
      method: GET
      url: https://api.example.com/user/.*
      url_type: pattern
    response:
      status: 200
      headers:
        Content-Type: application/json
      body: '{"user": "test-user", "email": "user@example.com"}'
